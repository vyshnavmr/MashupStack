            <li><b>Million Dollar Weekend</b> <blockquote><i>- Noah Kagan</i></blockquote></li>
            <p><span><u><q>Million Dollar Weekend </q></u></span> written by <span style="color: darkblue;"><i>Noah Kagan</i></span> is a practical and motivating guide for aspiring 
                entrepreneurs who want to launch a successful business quickly. 
                The book emphasizes the importance of validating your business idea within 48 hours 
                by securing paying customers before investing time or money on product development. 
                Kagan encourages focusing on creating "painkiller" products that solve 
                urgent problems rather than "vitamins," which are nice but optional.
